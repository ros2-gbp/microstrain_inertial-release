    1. Launch file setting "use_device_timestamp" (bool) created to allow user to select between device generated timestamp and packet received time (generated using PC time upon packet reception.)
    - Some applications require the PC received time to sync with other packages
    - Some applications require the device generated timestamp for accurate time of when the data was generated
    Hopefully, this satisfies both needs.
